Notes for JupyterLab for visualizing and analyzing cme tracks

Requirements for use:
1) an OSX machine
2) Anaconda (I recommend Anaconda over Miniconda if your computer has room)

Instructions:
1) open your Terminal
2) navigate to the directory where the code is located (.ipynb file and .yml file)
($ in front of text means it is typed into Terminal. Do not include the $ when copying into Terminal)
3) $conda update -n base -c defaults conda
4) $conda install -c anaconda pip
5) $conda env create -f visualization_environment.yml
6) $conda activate visualization
7) $jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
8) $jupyter lab

Enjoy
